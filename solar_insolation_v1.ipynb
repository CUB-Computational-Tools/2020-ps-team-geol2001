    "\n",
    "where q is the **insolation**, Z is the **zenith angle**, and S is the **solar constant**. \n",

    "Let's break down this equation. The solar constant is how much incoming radiation is received by earth from the sun, which is always constant. However, the zenith angle controls how much of this incoming radiation is received at different latitudes, which is not always constant. Think of it this way: at higher latitudes (far up north or down south), these latitudes receive less incoming solar radiation and hence, have a smaller insolation. This is why annual temperatures at the poles are so cold!\n",

    "The angle of the earth's tilt relative to the ecliptic will vary based on time of year. In summer in the northern hemisphere, the earth is tilted toward the sun by 23.45${^\\circ}$, which is why temperatures in the summer are warm. In winter in the northern hemisphere, the earth is tilted away from the sun by 23.45${^\\circ}$, so it is cold. At the equinoxes, the earth is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun, so the tilt does not impact our insolation calculations at these times.

The axial tilt of the earth varies from 22$^\\circ$ - 24.5$^\\circ$ on a timescale of 41,000 years. This is one component of Milankovitch cycles, which are orbital patterns that influence how much solar flux Earth receives. The other two orbital patterns are variation in the earth orbit's eccentricity and precession of the tilt.\n",
