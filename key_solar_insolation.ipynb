Contrastingly, a tilt of 22 produced the smallest insolation values in the SH during the **winter**. For **summer** in the NH with a tilt of 22, the opposite is true: an axial tilt of 22 produced the smallest insolation values, but in the SH in the **summer**, a tilt of 22 produced the largest insolation values. \n",
