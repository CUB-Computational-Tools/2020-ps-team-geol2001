    "Rain is a fundamental part of the water budget, and rainfall arrives in patterns that vary from time to time and from place to place. If you or someone you know lived in Boulder in 2013, you may recall the 2013 Colorado Floods. From September 11 to 15, a record amount of rain fell in Boulder County. In this lab, we will examine real data to explore local precipitation patterns and to appreciate just how incredible this flood event was.\n",

    "So far in this course, we've learned how to use Excel to generate, manipulate, and visualize data. Proficiency in Excel is a very important skill to have as a scientist, but there is also a rising demand for geologists to be literate in scientific coding. Therefore, this lab will introduce you to the Python programming language. As usual, our lab exercise will begin in Excel, but this time the first thing we'll learn how to do is save Excel data in a format that can easily be imported and read in a programming language. "
