    "Rain is a fundamental part of the water budget, and rainfall arrives in patterns that vary from time to time and from place to place. If you or someone you know lived in Boulder in 2013, you may recall the 2013 Colorado Floods. From September 11 to 15, a record amount of rain fell in Boulder County. In this lab, we will examine real data to explore local precipitation patterns and to appreciate just how incredible this flood event was.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, we've learned how to use Excel to generate, manipulate, and visualize data. Proficiency in Excel is a very important skill to have as a scientist, but there is also a rising demand for geologists to be literate in scientific coding. Therefore, this lab will introduce you to the Python programming language. As usual, our lab exercise will begin in Excel, but this time the first thing we'll learn how to do is save Excel data in a format that can easily be imported and read in a programming language. "

    "You should have access to a .xlsx file named `Lab5Excel_Rainfalldata.xlsx`. Open this file in Excel as usual, and you will see that it contains daily rainfall records. For the purpose of this lab, we're interested in both the annual rainfall and monthly rainfall records. We can convert our large amount of daily data (over 40,000 records!) into annual and monthly totals by creating pivot tables in Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create two pivot tables in Excel: one to sum the amount of precipitation for each year of record, and one to sum the amount of precipitation per month for each year of record. Make sure these pivot tables are stored on separate sheets in Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each pivot table, go to `File > Save As`. Change the filename to either `yearly_totals` or `monthly_totals.` From the dropdown menu, choose `CSV UTF-8 (*.csv)` as the filetype to save as.\n",

    "Excellent! Now that our data is in `.csv` format, Python will be able to read it. We'll use a Python library called `pandas` to read our data; you'll see that the data is output in table ('dataframe') format, which looks similar to Excel."
